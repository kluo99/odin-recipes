    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These pasta chips are crunchy, salty, and addicting. I 
        like them plain but feel free to serve them with a 
        marinara dipping sauce if desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally,
            until tender yet firm to bite, about 8 minutes.Drian,
             but do not rinse. Let sit for 2 minutes.

             and salt. Gently stir until evenly combined.
